::message_history

---

The last user message indicates that the user wants to make a modification to the BPMN process.

Based on the message history, and the last user message, construct a 'change request' in the form of a short string.

Example change requests:
- "Change task1 from a task to a user task"
- "Remove the gateway after task2"
- "Add a sequence flow from task1 to task3, and from task3 to task4"
- "Add a task between task2 and task3 where the customer provides feedback"

Your response will be in the form of a JSON object with a single key, "change_request", and a string value.

```json
{
    "change_request": "your change request here"
}
```
