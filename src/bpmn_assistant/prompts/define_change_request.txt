The last user message indicates that the user wants to make a modification to the process.

Based on the last user message, construct a detailed 'change request' in the form of a short string. Your change request should describe the modification needed, taking into account the available process editing capabilities.

Available process editing functions:
1. `delete_element(element_id)`
2. `redirect_branch(branch_condition, next_id)`
3. `add_element(element, before_id=None, after_id=None)`
4. `move_element(element_id, before_id=None, after_id=None)`
5. `update_element(new_element)`

Example change requests:
- "Update the label of task2 to 'Approve request'."
- "Remove the gateway with the ID 'gateway1'."
- "Add a task after task2. The new task should be a service task with the label 'Send email'."
- "Move task3 to be before task1."
- "Redirect the 'Yes' branch of gateway1 to flow to task4."

Your response should be a JSON object with a single key, "change_request", containing a string that describes the needed change in natural language.

```json
{
    "change_request": "your change request here"
}
```

Remember, you're describing the change needed, not specifying how to implement it programmatically.
